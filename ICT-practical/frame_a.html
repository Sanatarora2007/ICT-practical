        <p style ="font-size:90px;color:blue;text-align:CENTER;">SDG GOAL - Infrastructure and Industrialization</p>
        <p style ="font-size:50px;">Investment in infrastructure and innovation are crucial drivers of economic growth and development. With over half the world population now living in cities, mass transport and renewable energy are becoming ever more important, as are the growth of new industries and information and communication technologies.</p>
        <p style ="font-size:50px;">More than 4 billion people still do not have access to the Internet, and 90 percent are from the developing world. Bridging this digital divide is crucial to ensure equal access to information and knowledge, as well as foster innovation and entrepreneurship.</p>
